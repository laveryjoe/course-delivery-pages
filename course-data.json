Iterate and improve\n\n### Effective Prompting\n\nGood prompt:\n> \"Add a progress bar that shows percentage of completed lessons. Store completion in localStorage. Use the existing CSS variables for styling.\"\n\nBetter prompt:\n> \"Add a progress bar showing X of Y lessons complete. When user clicks 'Mark Complete', save to localStorage. Update the progress bar.
